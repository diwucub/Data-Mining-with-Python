Data Manipulation is the process of changing or transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis or reporting. It involves tasks such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and reshaping the data. This step is important because it allows you to clean, organize and prepare the data for further analysis.

There are several Python packages that are commonly used for Data Manipulation, including:

Pandas: is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, it provides data structures such as DataFrame and Series, that allow you to combine, filter, transform and shape your data. It also provides a wide range of built-in functions for data cleaning and transformation, such as dropna(), fillna(), groupby(), and pivot\_table().

Numpy: is a powerful library for array computation, it provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools to work with these arrays. It also provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions for data manipulation and transformation.

PySpark : is the python library for Spark programming, which is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, it also allows us to run data manipulation process in distributed computing environment.
