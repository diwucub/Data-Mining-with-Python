Data Integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. It involves the combination of data from different data types, structures, and formats to form a single data set that can be used for analysis and reporting. This step is important because it allows for the analysis of data from multiple sources, which can provide a more complete and accurate picture of the data being analyzed.

There are several Python packages that are commonly used for Data Integration, including:

Pandas: a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, it provides data structures such as DataFrame and Series, that allow you to combine, filter, transform and shape your data.

Numpy: is a powerful library for array computation, it provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools to work with these arrays.

BeautifulSoup: is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It is often used in web scraping, which is the process of extracting data from websites. Beautiful Soup provides a simple and efficient way to navigate, search, and modify the parse tree of an HTML or XML document.
