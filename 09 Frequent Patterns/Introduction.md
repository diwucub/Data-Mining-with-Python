Frequent pattern mining is a data mining task that aims to discover patterns or associations in a dataset that occur frequently. These patterns can be used to uncover relationships among items in the dataset, and can be used for tasks such as market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

There are many different Frequent Pattern methods we use with Scikit-Learn, but some of the most common include:

Apriori: An algorithm that generates frequent itemsets by iteratively removing itemsets that do not meet a minimum support threshold.

FP-growth: An algorithm that generates frequent itemsets by building a compact data structure called a frequent-pattern tree, which allows for efficient generation of frequent itemsets.
