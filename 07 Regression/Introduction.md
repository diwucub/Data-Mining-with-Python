Regression is a supervised learning task in which an algorithm learns to predict a continuous output value (or target) based on input features. The goal of regression is to find the best model that accurately predicts the target value for new, unseen inputs.

There are many different regression methods we use with Scikit-Learn, but some of the most common include:

Linear Regression: A simple model that finds the best linear relationship between the input features and the target value.

Polynomial Regression: A non-linear extension of linear regression that uses polynomial functions of the input features to fit the data.

Ridge Regression: A linear regression model that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting.

Lasso Regression: A linear regression model that includes a regularization term to shrink the coefficient of less important features to zero.

Decision Tree Regression: A tree-based model that uses a series of if-then rules to make predictions.

Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method that combines many decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions.

Gradient Boosting Regression: An ensemble method that combines many weak models to improve the accuracy of predictions.
