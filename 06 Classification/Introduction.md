Classification is a method of supervised learning in which an algorithm is trained to assign one or more predefined labels to a given input. The goal of classification is to learn a function that can accurately predict the class label of an unseen input, based on the class labels of a set of labeled training data. Classification algorithms typically take as input a set of feature values for a given input, and use these features to predict the class label. Common examples of classification problems include image recognition, spam detection, and natural language processing.

There are many different classification methods we use with Scikit-Learn, but some of the most common include:

Logistic Regression: A linear model that is often used for binary classification, where the goal is to predict one of two possible classes.

Decision Trees: A tree-based model that uses a series of if-then rules to make predictions.

Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines many decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that makes predictions based on the probability of each class given the input features.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs): A linear model that finds the best boundary between classes by maximizing the margin between them.

k-Nearest Neighbors: A simple method that uses the k closest labeled examples to the input in question to make a prediction

Gradient Boosting: An ensemble method that combines many weak models to improve the accuracy of predictions
