Data Statistical Understanding is the process of gaining insights and knowledge about the data through statistical analysis. This step involves tasks such as descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics. The goal is to understand the characteristics of the data, identify patterns, and make predictions about future data.

There are several Python packages that are commonly used for Data Statistical Understanding, including:

Pandas: provides a wide range of built-in functions for calculating summary statistics of the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

NumPy: provides tools for working with arrays and matrices, and also provides a wide range of mathematical and statistical functions.

SciPy: builds on NumPy and provides a wide range of scientific and technical computing tools, including optimization, signal processing, and statistics.

statsmodels: provides a wide range of statistical models, estimation procedures, and tests for use in data analysis.
