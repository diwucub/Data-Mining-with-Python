Clustering is an unsupervised learning task in which an algorithm groups a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). The goal of clustering is to discover the inherent groupings or structure in the data.

There are many different clustering methods we use with Scikit-Learn, but some of the most common include:

k-Means: A method that partitions a dataset into k clusters, where each cluster is defined by the mean of the points assigned to that cluster.

Hierarchical Clustering: A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster is split into smaller clusters or merged with other clusters.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based clustering method that groups together points that are close to each other, while marking as outliers points that are isolated.

Gaussian Mixture Model: A probabilistic model that represents a dataset as a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
