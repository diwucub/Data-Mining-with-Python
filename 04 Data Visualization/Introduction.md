Data Visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data in order to communicate information and insights effectively. The goal is to use visual elements such as charts, plots, and maps to make the data more accessible, understandable, and actionable for different audiences.

There are several Python packages that are commonly used for Data Visualization, including:

Pandas: integrates with other libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, that allows to generate various types of plots and visualizations, that can help understand the data, identify patterns and trends.

Matplotlib: is a 2D plotting library that provides a wide range of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It is widely used as the foundation for other libraries.

Seaborn: is a library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a higher-level interface for creating more attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is particularly useful for data visualization in statistics and data science.

Plotly: is a library for creating interactive and web-based visualizations. It provides a wide range of tools for creating plots, maps, and dashboards. It is particularly useful for creating interactive visualizations that can be embedded in web pages or apps.

PyViz: is a library that is composed of a set of libraries such as Holoviews, Geoviews, Datashader and more, for creating visualizations for complex data and large datasets.
